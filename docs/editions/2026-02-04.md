# Infectious Disease Epidemiology Brief

**Edition date:** February 4, 2026 (PT)  
**Time window covered:** Jan 25–Feb 4, 2026 (items older than this are explicitly labeled).

## 1) Executive Summary (5–8 bullets)
- **California—Measles exposure events (Los Angeles County):** LA County Public Health confirmed a measles case linked to an international traveler with **potential public exposure at LAX (TBIT Terminal B, Jan 26–27)** and **a Woodland Hills retail food location (Jan 30)**; monitoring windows extend into mid/late February. [LACDPH press release, Jan 31, 2026](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5240)
- **California—Measles exposure events (Orange County/Disneyland):** OC Health Care Agency reported an infectious measles case in an international traveler with **exposures at Disneyland Resort venues on Jan 28** and provided clear post-exposure guidance (MMR/IG considerations, symptom monitoring, and staying home when non-immune). [OC HCA press release, Jan 31, 2026](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- **California—TB outbreak in a school setting (San Francisco):** SFDPH issued a health advisory on a **tuberculosis outbreak at a local high school**, including clinician guidance for evaluation and reporting (serial assessments for exposed students/staff). [SFDPH advisory, Jan 29, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf) (index: [SFDPH health alerts](https://www.sf.gov/resource/2024/health-alerts))
- **California—Emerging clinical issue (TMVII):** SFDPH released an update on **Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII (TMVII)**, an emerging dermatophyte concern with implications for delayed diagnosis and ongoing transmission in close-contact networks. [SFDPH update, Jan 20, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)
- **National—Measles remains the dominant vaccine-preventable preparedness issue:** CDC reported **588 confirmed U.S. measles cases in 2026 as of Jan 29** (94% outbreak-associated) and documented that **kindergarten MMR coverage has fallen below the 95% target** nationally. [CDC measles cases and outbreaks (updated Jan 30, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html)
- **Preparedness/response implication (one sentence):** For the next 2–4 weeks, prioritize **MMR verification and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) workflows** in high-contact settings (airports, healthcare, schools), and ensure rapid **reporting + isolation pathways** for suspected measles and TB to prevent secondary transmission.

## 2) California: Key Developments

### a) Respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2)
**What happened:**
- This edition could not consistently retrieve CDPH’s statewide respiratory surveillance pages (technical access constraints; see Data Notes). We therefore leaned on **county-level surveillance narratives** where accessible and on clinician/operations guidance.
- San Mateo County maintains a public influenza page emphasizing vaccination and access pathways. [San Mateo County Health influenza page](https://www.smchealth.org/flu)

**Where:** California (county surveillance products vary by county and are not uniformly retrievable in this runtime).

**Who is affected:**
- High-risk patients (older adults, immunocompromised, chronic disease), and operationally: ED/urgent care, inpatient services, and occupational health programs during winter surge conditions.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **Know:** Multiple county-level products (per local reporting during this window) indicate significant influenza impact (ED visits, admissions, and deaths), with **heterogeneity in subtype emphasis** (e.g., H3 predominance highlighted in Riverside materials vs. H1N1 emphasized in Sacramento messaging). *(Citations pending—see Data Notes; links needed to archive county products reliably.)*
- **Don’t know (for statewide synthesis):** A single, authoritative statewide roll-up for the last 7–10 days could not be assembled here because CDPH respiratory dashboards/pages were intermittently inaccessible via automated retrieval during compilation.

**Public health response and guidance (clinician- and operations-facing):**
- A California Health Alert Network (CAHAN) influenza communication dated **Jan 5, 2026** was described in locally shared materials as emphasizing: vaccinate all eligible persons; use rapid molecular testing when available; and start antivirals promptly for high-risk or hospitalized patients without waiting for test confirmation. *(Citation pending—see Data Notes; URL needed.)*

**Practical implications (LHDs, clinicians, occupational epi):**
- Ensure **test-to-treat** access (especially ED/urgent care and SNF/LTACH transfer pathways).
- Reinforce work exclusion/return-to-work policies for symptomatic healthcare and congregate-setting staff to reduce on-the-job transmission during peak weeks.
- Treat measles readiness as “dual-use capacity” during respiratory season: triage separation, respiratory protection, and rapid isolation workflows help for both.

### b) Vaccine-preventable diseases (measles, pertussis, mumps)
**What happened:**
- **LA County:** A measles case linked to an international traveler was infectious during transit through **LAX TBIT Terminal B (Jan 26–27)** and visited **Dunkin’ Donuts in Woodland Hills (Jan 30)**. LA County provided monitoring windows and emphasized MMR protection and symptom vigilance. [LACDPH press release, Jan 31, 2026](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5240)
- **Orange County/Disneyland:** OC HCA described exposures at **Goofy’s Kitchen** and the **Disneyland parks** (Jan 28) and outlined PEP considerations and a 21-day post-exposure monitoring period. [OC HCA press release, Jan 31, 2026](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- **San Francisco (policy stance):** SFDPH reaffirmed commitment to the **evidence-based childhood immunization schedule**, supporting consistent clinician/school messaging amid misinformation pressures. [SFDPH advisory, Jan 7, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Advisory_-_Childhood_IZ_Schedule_2026.01.07.pdf)

**Where:** Los Angeles County; Orange County/Disneyland Resort; San Francisco.

**Who is affected (if known):**
- Potentially exposed travelers/visitors at LAX and Disneyland Resort sites; healthcare and public health staff implementing follow-up; school nurses and pediatric providers supporting vaccination catch-up.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know:** exposure locations/dates/times and monitoring windows were published by LA County and OC HCA.
- **We don’t know:** downstream secondary cases (if any) arising from these exposure sites; these often lag by 1–3 weeks and depend on case finding and reporting.

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Both LA County and OC HCA emphasize: confirm immunity; monitor for symptoms; and **call ahead** before seeking care to prevent healthcare-associated exposures. [LACDPH](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5240) · [OC HCA](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- CDC’s national situation framing underscores the operational risk: large proportions of cases are outbreak-associated and national MMR coverage is below the herd-immunity target. [CDC measles cases](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html)

**Practical implications for LHDs and clinicians:**
- **Healthcare systems:** validate measles triage protocols (masking at entry, immediate rooming, airborne isolation), and ensure your occupational health team has a clear plan for exposed staff assessment.
- **Airports, hospitality, schools:** ensure HR/occupational channels can rapidly verify MMR status and coordinate PEP referrals when advised by public health.

### c) Foodborne/waterborne (Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli*, hepatitis A)
**What happened:**
- No California-specific foodborne outbreak advisories were reliably retrievable from statewide/county sources in this runtime during the window (see Data Notes).
- For cross-jurisdictional preparedness, CDC’s outbreak resources remain the authoritative reference for investigation steps and prevention practices. [CDC outbreaks hub](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html)

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know:** multi-state outbreak investigations frequently require rapid isolate/sequence sharing and standardized exposure questionnaires.
- **We don’t know:** whether a specific California-linked product recall/advisory was posted by CDPH or counties during the last week (access limitations).

**Practical implications:**
- Support CIDT use with **reflex culture** when possible to preserve isolates for WGS and linkage.

### d) Vector-borne/zoonotic (West Nile, mpox, rabies-related alerts)
**What happened:**
- No new CA vector-borne surveillance updates were retrieved during this run. When local zoonotic risk messaging is needed, SFDPH’s prior respiratory-season update illustrates how to integrate seasonal influenza and avian influenza risk communication for clinicians.
  - *Older than window but operationally relevant:* [SFDPH update, Dec 17, 2025](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health-Update-Respiratory-Illness-Season-SFDPH-FINAL-12.17.2025_QuRjDSW.pdf)

### e) Healthcare-associated infections & AMR (with occupational epi lens)
**What happened:**
- **TB school outbreak advisory (SF):** High operational relevance for clinicians, school health, and occupational programs coordinating evaluation and return-to-school/work decisions. [SFDPH TB advisory, Jan 29, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
- **TMVII update (SF):** Relevant to sexual health clinics, dermatology, urgent care, and infection prevention programs due to potential for repeated visits, misclassification, and ongoing transmission without appropriate diagnosis/counseling. [SFDPH TMVII update, Jan 20, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)

**Practical implications:**
- Ensure frontline clinics have clear “**call-before-arrival**” instructions for suspected measles, and that airborne isolation rooms and workflows are functional (especially in ED/urgent care).

## 3) USA and World: Key Developments Outside California
1) **U.S. measles situation:** CDC reports 588 confirmed U.S. cases in 2026 as of Jan 29, with most outbreak-associated; national MMR kindergarten coverage has declined below 95%. [CDC measles cases and outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html)
2) **Guidance and methods signal channel:** CDC MMWR remains a key conduit for updates that affect laboratory and epidemiologic practice. [MMWR index](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)
3) **Outbreak operations reference:** CDC outbreak resources provide standardized investigation steps and prevention guidance for enteric outbreaks. [CDC outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html)
4) **Global situational awareness:** WHO Disease Outbreak News provides official reporting on selected events with potential international implications. [WHO DON](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news)

## 4) Watchlist (Next 2–4 weeks)
1) **Measles (travel-associated exposures, California hubs):** monitor for secondary transmission following LAX/Disney exposures; ensure rapid case reporting and exposure site management. [LACDPH measles PR](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5240) · [OC HCA measles PR](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
2) **TB congregate-setting clusters:** school-associated outbreaks require sustained serial evaluation and careful communication. [SFDPH TB advisory](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
3) **TMVII:** monitor for additional clinician alerts and local cluster recognition; reinforce diagnostic confirmation and transmission counseling. [SFDPH TMVII update](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)
4) **Respiratory season strain:** continue preparedness for high patient volumes and overlapping isolation needs.

## 5) Data Notes & Caveats
- **California surveillance access gaps:** Some CDPH and county surveillance pages were intermittently unavailable to automated retrieval in this environment due to site security controls and/or inconsistent TLS certificate chain delivery. The briefing therefore prioritizes **fetchable, official PDF advisories** (notably SFDPH) and directly accessible county press releases (LA/OC).
- **Citation gap (to close next run):** Several influenza impact metrics and the Jan 5 CAHAN influenza communication were provided via county products during the reporting window, but the underlying URLs were not retrievable/archivable from this runtime at compilation time. If you can paste the direct URLs for (1) Riverside County influenza weekly report/dashboard, (2) Sacramento respiratory summary, (3) San Diego respiratory surveillance product, and (4) the CAHAN message/PDF, I will replace the placeholders with full citations in the published edition.
- **Reporting lag:** Exposure investigations and outbreak tallies can change rapidly; absence of an item here is not evidence of absence.

## 6) One-Minute Takeaways
- **Activate measles readiness now:** review triage/airborne isolation workflows and staff exposure management; ensure “call ahead” is embedded in patient-facing messaging. [LACDPH](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5240)
- **Operationalize MMR/PEP pathways:** have a clear protocol for verifying immunity and coordinating vaccination/IG referrals for exposed high-risk individuals (infants, pregnant people without immunity, immunocompromised). [OC HCA](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- **TB outbreak response:** circulate the SFDPH TB advisory to peds/primary care/ED and school health partners; confirm reporting channels and testing capacity. [SFDPH TB advisory](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
- **TMVII clinical awareness:** add TMVII to differential reminders in sexual health/derm/urgent care; avoid repeated empiric treatment without diagnostics and counseling. [SFDPH TMVII update](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)
- **Keep a national scan loop:** check CDC measles updates weekly and monitor MMWR for guidance changes relevant to CA operations. [CDC measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) · [MMWR](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)
