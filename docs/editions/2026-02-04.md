# Infectious Disease Epidemiology Brief

**Edition date:** February 4, 2026 (PT)  
**Time window covered:** Jan 25–Feb 4, 2026 (items older than this are explicitly labeled).

## 1) Executive Summary (5–8 bullets)
- **California—Measles exposure events (Los Angeles County):** LA County Public Health confirmed a measles case linked to an international traveler with **potential public exposure at LAX (TBIT Terminal B, Jan 26–27)** and **a Woodland Hills retail food location (Jan 30)**; monitoring windows extend into mid/late February. [LACDPH press release, Jan 31, 2026](https://lacounty.gov/2026/01/31/public-health-confirms-second-2026-measles-case-linked-to-traveler/)
- **California—Measles exposure events (Orange County/Disneyland):** OC Health Care Agency reported an infectious measles case in an international traveler with **exposures at Disneyland Resort venues on Jan 28** and provided clear post-exposure guidance (MMR/IG considerations, symptom monitoring, and staying home when non-immune). [OC HCA press release, Jan 31, 2026](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- **California—TB outbreak in a school setting (San Francisco):** SFDPH issued a health advisory on a **tuberculosis outbreak at a local high school**, including clinician guidance for evaluation and reporting (serial assessments for exposed students/staff). [SFDPH advisory, Jan 29, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf) (index: [SFDPH health alerts](https://www.sf.gov/resource/2024/health-alerts))
- **California—Emerging clinical issue (TMVII):** SFDPH released an update on **Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII (TMVII)**, an emerging dermatophyte concern with implications for delayed diagnosis and ongoing transmission in close-contact networks. [SFDPH update, Jan 20, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)
- **National—Measles remains the dominant vaccine-preventable preparedness issue:** CDC reported **588 confirmed U.S. measles cases in 2026 as of Jan 29** (94% outbreak-associated) and documented that **kindergarten MMR coverage has fallen below the 95% target** nationally. [CDC measles cases and outbreaks (updated Jan 30, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html)
- **National/Global—Mpox clade I monitoring (importation + occupational readiness):** CDC reports **10 clade I mpox cases in the U.S. since Nov 2024** (largely travel-associated or linked to travelers) and notes overall U.S. risk remains low while monitoring continues; WHO continues to track the ongoing mpox outbreak and global situational context. [CDC mpox current situation (Jan 13, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html) · [WHO mpox outbreak situation page](https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/mpox-outbreak)
- **Preparedness/response implication (one sentence):** For the next 2–4 weeks, prioritize **MMR verification and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) workflows** in high-contact settings (airports, healthcare, schools), maintain **norovirus control discipline** in congregate settings, and ensure rapid **reporting + isolation pathways** for suspected measles and TB to prevent secondary transmission.

## 2) California: Key Developments

### a) Respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2)
**What happened:**
- This edition could not consistently retrieve CDPH’s statewide respiratory surveillance pages (technical access constraints; see Data Notes). We therefore leaned on **county-level surveillance narratives** where accessible and on clinician/operations guidance.
- San Mateo County maintains a public influenza page emphasizing vaccination and access pathways. [San Mateo County Health influenza page](https://www.smchealth.org/flu)

**Where:** California (county surveillance products vary by county and are not uniformly retrievable in this runtime).

**Who is affected:**
- High-risk patients (older adults, immunocompromised, chronic disease), and operationally: ED/urgent care, inpatient services, and occupational health programs during winter surge conditions.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **Know:** Multiple county reports show significant influenza impact (ED visits, admissions, deaths) and heterogeneity in strain/subtype emphasis. For example, Riverside County’s influenza surveillance report (Issue 17, Week 03) reported **805 positive influenza lab results (up from 559 prior week)** and **65 new influenza admissions (up from 41)**, and noted that among subtyped influenza A specimens **A(H3)** predominated. [Riverside influenza surveillance report (PDF)](https://www.ruhealth.org/sites/default/files/PH/Disease%20Control/docs/county-of-riverside-influenza-surveillance-report-2025-26-season-issue-17-week-03.pdf)  
  Separately, Sacramento County reported **14 influenza-associated deaths** and **74 ICU admissions (ages 18–64)** and stated cases were predominantly **influenza A(H1N1)** in their local update. [Sacramento County influenza update](https://dhs.saccounty.gov/Pages/NR-Sacramento-County-Influenza-Update.aspx)
- **Don’t know (for statewide synthesis):** CDPH statewide respiratory dashboards/pages were intermittently inaccessible via automated retrieval during compilation, limiting direct statewide roll-ups in this edition.

**Public health response and guidance (clinician- and operations-facing):**
- **CAHAN influenza guidance (Jan 5, 2026):** OC HCA reposted a CAHAN disease notification emphasizing vaccination, rapid molecular testing, and **prompt antivirals for high-risk or hospitalized patients without waiting for test results**; it noted **A(H3N2)** predominance and referenced a newly emerged **H3N2 subclade K** with expected vaccine protection against severe disease despite antigenic drift. [OC HCA CAHAN notification](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/cd-news-alert/cahan-disease-notification-influenza-update-vaccinate-test-and-administer-influenza)

**Practical implications (LHDs, clinicians, occupational epi):**
- Ensure **test-to-treat** access (especially ED/urgent care and SNF/LTACH transfer pathways).
- Reinforce work exclusion/return-to-work policies for symptomatic healthcare and congregate-setting staff to reduce on-the-job transmission during peak weeks.
- Treat measles readiness as “dual-use capacity” during respiratory season: triage separation, respiratory protection, and rapid isolation workflows help for both.

### b) Vaccine-preventable diseases (measles, pertussis, mumps)
**What happened:**
- **LA County:** A measles case linked to an international traveler was infectious during transit through **LAX TBIT Terminal B (Jan 26–27)** and visited **Dunkin’ Donuts in Woodland Hills (Jan 30)**. LA County provided monitoring windows and emphasized MMR protection and symptom vigilance. [LACDPH press release, Jan 31, 2026](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5240)
- **Orange County/Disneyland:** OC HCA described exposures at **Goofy’s Kitchen** and the **Disneyland parks** (Jan 28) and outlined PEP considerations and a 21-day post-exposure monitoring period. [OC HCA press release, Jan 31, 2026](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- **San Francisco (policy stance):** SFDPH reaffirmed commitment to the **evidence-based childhood immunization schedule**, supporting consistent clinician/school messaging amid misinformation pressures. [SFDPH advisory, Jan 7, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Advisory_-_Childhood_IZ_Schedule_2026.01.07.pdf)

**Where:** Los Angeles County; Orange County/Disneyland Resort; San Francisco.

**Who is affected (if known):**
- Potentially exposed travelers/visitors at LAX and Disneyland Resort sites; healthcare and public health staff implementing follow-up; school nurses and pediatric providers supporting vaccination catch-up.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know:** exposure locations/dates/times and monitoring windows were published by LA County and OC HCA.
- **We don’t know:** downstream secondary cases (if any) arising from these exposure sites; these often lag by 1–3 weeks and depend on case finding and reporting.

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Both LA County and OC HCA emphasize: confirm immunity; monitor for symptoms; and **call ahead** before seeking care to prevent healthcare-associated exposures. [LACDPH](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5240) · [OC HCA](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- CDC’s national situation framing underscores the operational risk: large proportions of cases are outbreak-associated and national MMR coverage is below the herd-immunity target. [CDC measles cases](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html)

**Practical implications for LHDs and clinicians:**
- **Healthcare systems:** validate measles triage protocols (masking at entry, immediate rooming, airborne isolation), and ensure your occupational health team has a clear plan for exposed staff assessment.
- **Airports, hospitality, schools:** ensure HR/occupational channels can rapidly verify MMR status and coordinate PEP referrals when advised by public health.

### c) Foodborne/waterborne (Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli*, hepatitis A; norovirus)
**What happened:**
- **Multistate Salmonella outbreak (dietary supplements):** CDC reported **65 illnesses** in a multistate outbreak linked to **moringa leaf in dietary supplements** and notes the true number of sick people is likely much higher due to under-testing; consumers should discard/return recalled products. [CDC outbreak locations page (Jan 29, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/supergreenssupplementpowders-1-26/locations.html)
- CDC publishes a national “Current Outbreaks” page summarizing active multistate foodborne investigations and noting that only some investigations result in online outbreak notices. [CDC Current Outbreaks (last updated Jan 27, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/foodborne-outbreaks/outbreaks/index.html)
- **Norovirus (seasonal operational risk):** CDPH and local health departments continue to emphasize standard controls (hand hygiene with soap/water, environmental disinfection, and exclusion policies for symptomatic food handlers). LA County’s norovirus guidance also reiterates that infected people should avoid preparing food while symptomatic and for **at least 48 hours after recovery**, and highlights bleach/EPA-listed disinfectants. [LACDPH Norovirus body text](http://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/Norovirus/indexBody.htm) · [CDC: How to Prevent Norovirus](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html)

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know:** multistate outbreak investigations frequently require rapid isolate/sequence sharing and standardized exposure questionnaires; norovirus control relies heavily on environmental and occupational policies (exclusion, cleaning) rather than medical countermeasures.
- **We don’t know:** whether a specific California-linked product recall/advisory was posted by CDPH or counties during the last week (access limitations).

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Reinforce food handler exclusion policies and cleaning/disinfection protocols for suspected norovirus outbreaks in congregate settings, especially schools, shelters, jails, SNFs/LTACHs.

**Practical implications:**
- Support CIDT use with **reflex culture** when possible to preserve isolates for WGS and linkage.
- Occupational epi: ensure facilities have explicit, enforceable sick-leave/exclusion policies that make “stay home for 48 hours after symptoms end” feasible. [CDC norovirus prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html)

### d) Vector-borne/zoonotic (West Nile, mpox, rabies-related alerts)
**What happened:**
- **Mpox (clade I importation monitoring):** CDC reports **10 clade I mpox cases in the U.S. since Nov 2024** and describes clade I as largely travel-associated or linked to travelers; CDC notes overall U.S. risk remains low while monitoring continues. [CDC mpox current situation (Jan 13, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html)
- No new CA vector-borne surveillance updates were retrieved during this run. When local zoonotic risk messaging is needed, SFDPH’s prior respiratory-season update illustrates how to integrate seasonal influenza and avian influenza risk communication for clinicians.
  - *Older than window but operationally relevant:* [SFDPH update, Dec 17, 2025](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health-Update-Respiratory-Illness-Season-SFDPH-FINAL-12.17.2025_QuRjDSW.pdf)

**Practical implications:**
- Maintain clinician readiness for diagnosis and PPE in sexual health, ED, and urgent care settings; ensure linkage to vaccination where indicated and reinforce exposure management for healthcare personnel when mpox is suspected. [CDC mpox current situation](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html) · [WHO mpox outbreak situation page](https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/mpox-outbreak)

### e) Healthcare-associated infections & AMR (with occupational epi lens)
**What happened:**
- **TB school outbreak advisory (SF):** High operational relevance for clinicians, school health, and occupational programs coordinating evaluation and return-to-school/work decisions. [SFDPH TB advisory, Jan 29, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
- **TMVII update (SF):** Relevant to sexual health clinics, dermatology, urgent care, and infection prevention programs due to potential for repeated visits, misclassification, and ongoing transmission without appropriate diagnosis/counseling. [SFDPH TMVII update, Jan 20, 2026](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)

**Practical implications:**
- Ensure frontline clinics have clear “**call-before-arrival**” instructions for suspected measles, and that airborne isolation rooms and workflows are functional (especially in ED/urgent care).

## 3) USA and World: Key Developments Outside California
1) **U.S. measles situation:** CDC reports 588 confirmed U.S. cases in 2026 as of Jan 29, with most outbreak-associated; national MMR kindergarten coverage has declined below 95%. [CDC measles cases and outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html)
2) **U.S. Salmonella outbreak (supplements):** CDC reported **65 illnesses** in a multistate Salmonella outbreak linked to **moringa leaf in dietary supplements** and notes the true number is likely higher due to under-testing; consumers should discard/return recalled products. [CDC outbreak locations page (Jan 29, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/supergreenssupplementpowders-1-26/locations.html)
3) **Mpox clade I monitoring:** CDC reports 10 clade I mpox cases in the U.S. since Nov 2024 and notes overall U.S. risk remains low while monitoring continues. [CDC mpox current situation (Jan 13, 2026)](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html)
4) **HAI progress signals (national):** CDC’s 2024 HAI Progress Report highlights year-over-year declines among acute care hospitals including a **9% decrease in CLABSI**, **10% decrease in CAUTI**, **7% decrease in hospital-onset MRSA bacteremia**, and **11% decrease in hospital-onset C. difficile infections** (2024 vs 2023). [CDC Current HAI Progress Report](https://www.cdc.gov/healthcare-associated-infections/php/data/progress-report.html)
5) **Guidance and methods signal channel:** CDC MMWR remains a key conduit for updates that affect laboratory and epidemiologic practice. [MMWR index](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)
6) **Global situational awareness:** WHO Disease Outbreak News provides official reporting on selected events with potential international implications. [WHO DON](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news)
7) **Global mpox context:** WHO maintains a central mpox outbreak situation page (PHEIC declared Aug 14, 2024; ongoing activity noted). [WHO mpox outbreak](https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/mpox-outbreak)

## 4) Watchlist (Next 2–4 weeks)
1) **Measles (travel hubs + high-density venues):** anticipate downstream contact investigations and possible workforce exclusions after LAX and Disneyland-associated exposures; ensure rapid reporting and exposure management. [LACDPH measles PR](https://lacounty.gov/2026/01/31/public-health-confirms-second-2026-measles-case-linked-to-traveler/) · [OC HCA measles PR](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
2) **Influenza severity and strain mix (county heterogeneity):** county products suggest high seasonal activity with possible differences in subtype emphasis; watch ICU stress indicators and keep low-friction antiviral access (“test early, treat early”). *(Citations pending; see Data Notes.)*
3) **TB congregate-setting clusters:** SFDPH’s school outbreak highlights the need for rapid evaluation pipelines and strict adherence to reporting timelines. [SFDPH TB advisory](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
4) **Norovirus (congregate settings):** anticipate episodic clusters in LTC, shelters, schools, and food service; reinforce exclusion and disinfection protocols now. [LACDPH Norovirus](https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/Norovirus/) · [CDC norovirus prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html)
5) **Mpox clade I importations + occupational exposure readiness:** maintain PPE/triage readiness and vaccination pathways for eligible groups; use CDC situational updates for risk communication. [CDC mpox current situation](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html)

## 5) Data Notes & Caveats
- **California surveillance access gaps:** Some CDPH and county surveillance pages were intermittently unavailable to automated retrieval in this environment due to site security controls and/or inconsistent TLS certificate chain delivery. The briefing therefore prioritizes **fetchable, official PDF advisories** (notably SFDPH) and directly accessible county press releases (LA/OC).
- **Resolved citation gaps (influenza):** Direct source URLs for Riverside County influenza surveillance, Sacramento County influenza update, and the Jan 5 CAHAN influenza notification (via OC HCA) were added and cited in-text. Remaining gaps are limited to items where PDFs/HTML are available but not yet parsed into extractable weekly metrics in this runtime (see next bullet).
- **PDF parsing limitation (some county reports):** Several county surveillance products are published as PDFs; in this environment we can fetch the PDF reliably, but automated text extraction is inconsistent. When you see “PDF (fetched)” in this edition, the citation is stable even if we cannot quote additional table values beyond those explicitly stated in the text.
- **Reporting lag:** Exposure investigations and outbreak tallies can change rapidly; absence of an item here is not evidence of absence.

## 6) One-Minute Takeaways
- **Stand up an MMR verification + PEP playbook for high-contact employers (airports, healthcare, schools):** include staff rostering contingencies for exclusions and a “call ahead” plan for symptomatic persons to protect facilities. [LACDPH measles PR](https://lacounty.gov/2026/01/31/public-health-confirms-second-2026-measles-case-linked-to-traveler/) · [OC HCA measles PR](https://ochealthinfo.com/press/infectious-measles-case-visits-orange-county)
- **Push “test early, treat early” for influenza in ED/urgent care and SNF/LTACH transfer pathways:** don’t delay antivirals for high-risk patients awaiting results. [OC HCA CAHAN influenza update, Jan 5, 2026](https://www.ochealthinfo.com/cd-news-alert/cahan-disease-notification-influenza-update-vaccinate-test-and-administer-influenza)
- **Audit airborne isolation readiness (dual-use for measles/TB):** triage signage, masking/respirators, transport routes, and contact tracing triggers. [SFDPH TB advisory](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
- **Reinforce norovirus controls in congregate settings now:** food handler exclusion (and 48 hours after symptoms end), disinfectant selection, and rapid outbreak reporting channels. [LACDPH Norovirus](https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/Norovirus/) · [CDC norovirus prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html)
- **Maintain mpox PPE/triage readiness and vaccination pathways:** use CDC situational updates for risk communication and occupational exposure management. [CDC mpox current situation](https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/situation-summary/index.html)
