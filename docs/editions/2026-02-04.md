# Infectious Disease Epidemiology Brief

**Edition date:** 2026-02-04  
**Window covered:** ~2026-01-25 to 2026-02-04 (most recent 7–10 days; older items flagged when included for operational relevance).

## 1) Executive Summary (5–8 bullets)
- **San Francisco (TB):** SFDPH issued a **health advisory on a tuberculosis outbreak at a local high school**, with clinician-facing evaluation and reporting guidance. Implication: review school-associated exposure workflows (student + staff) and ensure rapid linkage to TB testing and public health reporting. [SFDPH advisory, 2026-01-29](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf) (index: [SFDPH health alerts](https://www.sf.gov/resource/2024/health-alerts)).
- **San Francisco (emerging dermatophyte):** SFDPH released an update on **Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII (TMVII)**—an emerging dermatophyte pattern reported internationally and in the U.S. with potential for delayed diagnosis and transmission in close-contact networks. Implication: raise awareness in sexual health, urgent care, and dermatology settings; confirmatory testing and counseling are key. [SFDPH update, 2026-01-20](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf) (index: [SFDPH health alerts](https://www.sf.gov/resource/2024/health-alerts)).
- **San Francisco (immunizations):** SFDPH reaffirmed commitment to the **evidence-based childhood immunization schedule** amid ongoing vaccine misinformation pressures. Implication: align messaging across clinics/schools and reinforce routine coverage (MMR, DTaP/Tdap, varicella) before spring/summer travel. [SFDPH advisory, 2026-01-07](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Advisory_-_Childhood_IZ_Schedule_2026.01.07.pdf).
- **California baseline (COVID-19):** CDPH continues to maintain statewide COVID-19 clinical and public guidance and links to surveillance resources. Implication: keep testing-to-treatment pathways functioning for high-risk patients (ED/urgent care/primary care). [CDPH COVID-19 page](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx).
- **National (MMWR):** CDC’s MMWR remains a key signal channel for methods and guidance updates (including SARS-CoV-2 testing/variant monitoring and immunocompromised patient guidance). Implication: ensure laboratorians and infection prevention teams track assay/variant monitoring advisories. [MMWR index](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html).
- **National (outbreak readiness):** CDC’s outbreak resources and investigation pages remain the authoritative reference point for multi-state foodborne response and travel health notices. Implication: maintain readiness for cross-jurisdictional case finding and specimen forwarding. [CDC current outbreak list](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html).

**Preparedness/response implication (one sentence):** In California, the most actionable near-term items are **tightening TB outbreak response in school settings**, improving clinician recognition of **TMVII** and other atypical presentations, and maintaining **routine immunization and testing-to-treatment pathways** while monitoring national outbreak signals.

## 2) California: Key Developments

### a) Respiratory viruses (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2)
**What happened (CA signals accessible this week):**
- Statewide, CDPH continues to consolidate COVID-19 guidance and links to surveillance and public health recommendations. [CDPH COVID-19](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx)
- In San Francisco, SFDPH’s recent respiratory-season communication (late 2025) remains relevant operationally for clinicians managing overlapping influenza/COVID/RSV and avian influenza risk communication; it provides a local template for clinical emphasis even when weekly statewide trend documents are not easily accessible programmatically. [SFDPH “Seasonal Influenza and Avian Influenza (H5N1)” update, 2025-12-17](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health-Update-Respiratory-Illness-Season-SFDPH-FINAL-12.17.2025_QuRjDSW.pdf).

**Where:** California statewide (CDPH); San Francisco (SFDPH).

**Who is affected:**
- Clinically high-risk patients (older adults, immunocompromised, cardiopulmonary disease) and congregate settings; healthcare workers exposed to respiratory pathogens in ED/ICU/urgent care.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know** CDPH guidance is current and centralized; SFDPH has issued recent clinician updates for respiratory season.  
- **We don’t know (from machine-accessible sources today):** up-to-the-week California statewide test positivity or hospitalization trends for influenza/RSV/SARS-CoV-2 because the CDPH respiratory surveillance pages were not retrievable with standard TLS verification in this environment (see Data Notes).

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Keep **testing-to-treatment** operational for COVID-19 and influenza where indicated; validate that frontline sites can rapidly dispense/arrange antivirals for high-risk patients. [CDPH COVID-19](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx)

**Practical implications (LHDs + clinicians):**
- Audit: same-day respiratory testing capacity, after-hours prescribing pathways, and occupational exposure policies for staff in high-throughput settings.
- Consider adding TMVII and TB (below) to differential diagnosis reminders during respiratory season, as cough/rash presentations can overlap with other syndromes.

### b) Vaccine-preventable diseases (measles, pertussis, mumps)
**What happened:**
- SFDPH issued an advisory that **reaffirms evidence-based childhood immunization schedules** and provides a clear stance useful for healthcare systems and school health partners amid misinformation dynamics. [SFDPH advisory, 2026-01-07](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Advisory_-_Childhood_IZ_Schedule_2026.01.07.pdf).

**Where:** San Francisco.

**Who is affected:**
- Children and adolescents (school and childcare cohorts), and—operationally—school nurses, pediatric practices, and immunization program teams.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know** SFDPH is emphasizing schedule adherence; this is consistent with national best practice.
- **We don’t know** (from accessible sources today) whether there were new California measles/pertussis case surges in the last 7–10 days statewide; include routine surveillance review when access is restored.

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Use consistent messaging tied to routine schedules; emphasize MMR coverage prior to travel and in under-immunized communities. [SFDPH advisory](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Advisory_-_Childhood_IZ_Schedule_2026.01.07.pdf)

**Practical implications:**
- Hospitals/clinics: ensure frontline staff know where to send suspected measles notifications and how to implement airborne isolation rapidly.
- LHDs: strengthen school partnerships for catch-up vaccination clinics before spring breaks.

### c) Foodborne/waterborne (Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing *E. coli*, hepatitis A)
**What happened:**
- No specific California-localized outbreak advisories were reliably retrievable from CDPH or LA County pages today due to technical access constraints (see Data Notes). As a national reference point for multi-state foodborne response workflows and resources, CDC’s outbreak hub remains central. [CDC current outbreak list](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html).

**Where:** National reference; California monitoring.

**Who is affected:**
- General population; heightened risk for older adults, young children, pregnant people, and immunocompromised patients.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know** CDC maintains the authoritative investigation and prevention resources.
- **We don’t know** which (if any) California-specific foodborne alerts were posted in the last week on certain county sites due to access limitations.

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Keep case interview capacity and specimen forwarding channels ready for potential multi-state investigations. [CDC outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html)

**Practical implications:**
- Clinicians: ensure stool testing practices support culture-independent diagnostic testing (CIDT) plus reflex culture when indicated to preserve isolates for WGS.
- LHDs: pre-identify rapid communication channels with major health systems for clusters and product traceback.

### d) Vector-borne/zoonotic (West Nile, mpox, rabies-related alerts)
**What happened:**
- SFDPH’s recent respiratory-season update explicitly included avian influenza (H5N1) risk communication alongside seasonal influenza—useful for clinician messaging even outside an acute local event. [SFDPH update, 2025-12-17](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health-Update-Respiratory-Illness-Season-SFDPH-FINAL-12.17.2025_QuRjDSW.pdf).

**Where:** San Francisco (clinician communications); statewide relevance.

**Who is affected:**
- Patients with animal exposure risks (backyard poultry, wildlife contact), agricultural workers, and clinicians evaluating unusual influenza-like illness.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know** local health departments are integrating zoonotic risk communication into routine respiratory messaging.
- **We don’t know** current California arboviral activity from CDPH surveillance pages in this environment; needs follow-up once access is restored.

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Reinforce exposure histories (animal contact, occupational exposures) during respiratory illness evaluations.

**Practical implications:**
- Occupational epi: prioritize worker protection protocols for animal-exposed jobs; ensure pathways for prompt evaluation after relevant exposures.

### e) Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) & antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
**What happened (occupational/clinical relevance):**
- **TMVII update** is particularly relevant to frontline clinicians and sexual health services; delayed recognition can contribute to prolonged symptoms, repeat visits, and ongoing transmission in close-contact networks. [SFDPH TMVII update, 2026-01-20](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf).
- **TB school outbreak advisory** has immediate occupational implications for school staff and healthcare workers involved in evaluation, testing, and follow-up. [SFDPH TB advisory, 2026-01-29](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf).

**Where:** San Francisco; broader applicability for CA healthcare and public health operations.

**Who is affected:**
- School staff and exposed students (TB advisory); sexual health networks and clinicians (TMVII);
- Occupational health teams coordinating evaluation and return-to-work decisions.

**What we know vs. don’t know:**
- **We know** SFDPH provides detailed clinical evaluation and reporting directions for the suspected TB outbreak setting.
- **We don’t know** (from accessible sources today) whether other CA counties have parallel advisories in the last 7–10 days (LA/Santa Clara sites not fully retrievable).

**Public health response and guidance:**
- Ensure rapid reporting, contact investigation coordination, and clinician-lab-public health alignment for TB diagnostics.

**Practical implications:**
- Hospitals: review TB evaluation pathways (IGRA/TST, CXR, NAAT/culture where indicated), airborne isolation practices, and communication with local TB control.
- Schools/LHDs: confirm staff exposure notification templates, confidentiality protections, and capacity for on-site or rapid referral testing.

## 3) USA and World: Key Developments Outside California (5–8 brief items)
1) **CDC MMWR signal channel:** The MMWR landing page remains the primary index for weekly CDC reports and methodology notes that can affect clinical/public health practice (e.g., diagnostic markers for variant monitoring; immunocompromised guidance). [MMWR index](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)
2) **CDC outbreak readiness:** CDC’s outbreak resources are the central reference point for food safety prevention and multi-state investigation support. [CDC outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html)
3) **Travel notices:** CDC travel notices are a practical early-warning tool for imported infection risks (relevant for California travel hubs). [CDC travel notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)
4) **WHO DON (global situational awareness):** WHO’s Disease Outbreak News provides official reports on select international events meeting IHR criteria; California programs should periodically scan for events with importation potential (travel, migration, supply chains). [WHO DON](https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news)
5) **Occupational lens reminder:** National guidance updates often arrive first via CDC clinician-facing channels (HAN, MMWR) and should be routed to hospital epidemiology + occupational health for operationalization. [CDC MMWR](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html)

## 4) Watchlist (Next 2–4 weeks)
1) **TB (school-associated outbreaks):** school and workplace exposures require fast coordination across clinical care, public health, and occupational health; monitor for additional advisories in other counties. [SFDPH TB advisory, 2026-01-29](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
2) **TMVII and other atypical dermatophytes:** potential for delayed diagnosis, misclassification, and onward transmission; monitor for additional U.S. guidance and local case clusters. [SFDPH TMVII update, 2026-01-20](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)
3) **Routine childhood immunization coverage:** watch for pockets of declining uptake that elevate measles/pertussis risk ahead of spring travel and mass gatherings. [SFDPH immunization schedule advisory, 2026-01-07](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Advisory_-_Childhood_IZ_Schedule_2026.01.07.pdf)
4) **Respiratory season co-circulation:** influenza/COVID/RSV continue to stress EDs and staffing; maintain testing and antiviral access while monitoring for zoonotic influenza risk communication needs. [SFDPH respiratory season update, 2025-12-17](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health-Update-Respiratory-Illness-Season-SFDPH-FINAL-12.17.2025_QuRjDSW.pdf)
5) **Foodborne multi-state outbreaks:** continue readiness for cluster detection and WGS-based linkage; ensure CIDT-plus-culture reflex where possible. [CDC outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html)

## 5) Data Notes & Caveats
- **Access limitations for this edition:** Several California-first official pages (notably some CDPH respiratory surveillance paths and some county news pages) were not retrievable in this runtime using standard automated fetching due to **TLS certificate chain delivery issues** on the remote host and/or **website security controls (e.g., Cloudflare blocks)**. This edition therefore leans more heavily on **SFDPH clinician alerts** and national sources.
- **Reporting lags:** Outbreak confirmation and line lists typically lag initial signals; absence of an alert in this briefing is **not evidence of absence**.
- **Surveillance definition changes:** Respiratory and lab surveillance metrics can shift with testing behavior; interpret short-term changes cautiously.

## 6) One-Minute Takeaways (actionable this week)
- **Hospitals/clinics:** circulate SFDPH’s **TB school outbreak advisory** to ED/urgent care/peds + occupational health; ensure staff know the reporting and evaluation workflow. [SFDPH TB advisory](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/TB_Health_Advisory_-_Suspected_TB_Outbreak_Jan_2026-SFDPH-FINAL-1.29.2026_kToXjfD.pdf)
- **Clinician education:** add **TMVII** to differential diagnosis reminders in sexual health/dermatology/primary care; avoid repeated empiric treatment without diagnostic confirmation. [SFDPH TMVII update](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Update_-_Trichophyton_mentagrophytes_genotype_VII_TMVII_2026.01.20.pdf)
- **Immunizations:** align messaging across pediatrics, schools, and health systems around the **routine childhood schedule**; plan catch-up outreach ahead of spring travel. [SFDPH immunization advisory](https://media.api.sf.gov/documents/Health_Advisory_-_Childhood_IZ_Schedule_2026.01.07.pdf)
- **Respiratory readiness:** validate testing-to-treatment and antiviral access pathways for high-risk patients; confirm staffing contingency plans. [CDPH COVID-19 page](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx)
- **Epi operations:** keep a weekly scan workflow for **MMWR** and **CDC outbreak investigations** to catch guidance changes and multi-state events early. [MMWR index](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/index.html) · [CDC outbreaks](https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html)
